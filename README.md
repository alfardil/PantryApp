Pantry Tracker project that utilizes [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Users can log whatever item they would like and it will be stored under their unique authentication for future reference.

Future implementations for this project include adding an AI wrapper to generate recipes, image input, and updated UI/UX.
